# Supervised-Learning
Analysis of LendingClub Loans
Purpose
Goal

Improve the gross margin of LendingClub through the identification of problematic loans at the time of issuance for further analysis and/or allocation to securitization facilities.

Objective

Develop a supervised learning model that can effectively predict whether a loan will be fully paid off or charged off at the time of loan approval.


Summary

Based on the precision and recall scores of the model, we are able to match the current weighted average charge off rate on LendingClub's loans of 8.20%.

This lends credence to the company using a similar proprietary scoring model based on the features used in this project.
Gradient Boosting and eXtreme Gradient Boosting Train CV Score, Test Accuracy Score, and Test Fbeta score favoring recall were identical and either can be used for future development.
